## Overview

Welcome to Chapter 02 of the Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) lab series. This chapter focuses on building a deep, practical understanding of Python’s threading system and the synchronization tools required to coordinate concurrent execution safely.

Unlike simple multithreading examples, this chapter explores both low-level thread construction and advanced synchronization patterns, showing how Python manages shared resources, avoids race conditions, and enables structured concurrency.

The chapter is organized into two major parts:

- Part 1: Fundamental concepts of threading behavior and synchronization theory  
- Part 2: Hands-on Python implementations demonstrating real-world thread coordination patterns

## PART 1: THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

### 1. Threading and Shared Execution Environment

In Python, threads run inside a single process and share the same memory space. This enables fast communication but introduces serious risks when multiple threads modify shared variables simultaneously.

Key Problem:
- Threads execute unpredictably due to CPU scheduling  
- Shared variables may be updated inconsistently  

Critical Section:
A section of code where shared resources are accessed. Without control mechanisms, this leads to inconsistent program states and unpredictable outputs.

### 2. Synchronization Mechanisms

#### Locks (Mutex)
A Lock ensures that only one thread executes a critical section at a time. Other threads are blocked until the lock is released.

#### RLock (Re-entrant Lock)
An advanced lock that allows the same thread to acquire the lock multiple times without deadlocking. Useful in recursive or nested function calls.

#### Events
Events act as signaling flags between threads. One thread signals completion or readiness, while others wait until the signal is triggered.

#### Conditions
Condition variables combine locking and signaling, allowing threads to wait until a specific state is met before continuing execution.

#### Semaphores
A Semaphore controls access to a resource pool using a counter instead of a binary lock. Example: allowing N threads to access a limited resource simultaneously.

### 3. Thread Communication using Queue

The Queue module provides a safe way for threads to exchange data.

Producer–Consumer Model:
- Producers generate data and insert it into the queue  
- Consumers retrieve and process data safely  
- Queue internally handles locking and synchronization  

This eliminates the need for manual lock management in many cases.
